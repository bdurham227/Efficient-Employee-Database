## Description
The Efficient Employee Database is a Content Management Systems that efficiently connects the user with the database. This command line program is built upon node, inquirer and MYSQL npms as solution to efficiently manage any companys employees, roles and departments. This CLI allows any user to view all employees, role and departments in a company as well as allows them to to create new departments, employees roles, and update current employee's roles. At first, architecting and building out this application was frustrating because I felt more comfortable working in MYSQL workbench, and the merge of that workspace to Visual Studio Code for (whatever reasons) really threw me off. Nonetheless, I aimed to push myself to get more comfortable with high order array methods like .map() and tried my hand out using the newly taught async/await wombo combo. Areas I would like to improve upon would be to further refactor the code, make it 100% asynchronous, and too add more functions to fulfill the CRUD principles of create, read, update, and destroy.
